For this project I've created a single activity Calculator Mobile App. Users can add, subtract, multiply, and divide. To run the app connect a physical device to your laptop or download
an emulator through android studio. Click BuildProject in Android Studio and then click the green run button in the upper portion of the screen. This application was implmented using two 
different architectures: MVVM and MVP.
